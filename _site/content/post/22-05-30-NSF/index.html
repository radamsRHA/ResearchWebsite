<p>We have some exciting news: our collaborative NSF-ROA proposal “Leveraging genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes alongside student training to improve genome annotation” has been accepted for funding!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This proposal represents a collaborative effort with the McKenna lab at the University of Memphis to improve annotation of difficult-to-find genes (e.g., olfactory receptor) in longhorned beetles. Rich will be a visiting scientist at UofM in Summer 2022, and this proposal will fund undergraduate researchers to work on the problem of “fantastic genes and where to find them”.</p>

<p>Exciting things ahead!</p>
