    - title: Genomic adaptation & ancestry
      content: We are developing a number of systems to test fundamental evolutionary hypotheses about rapid evolution in nature using native and invasive insects

    - title:  'Statistical Population Genomics: 
*predicting adaptation & ancestry*'
      content: 'We study population genomic variation using new predictive approaches for classifying genomic regions, predicting genetic ancestry, and reconstructing demography. We seek to apply these methods in several insect systems to illuminate the molecular basis of rapid adaptation.'

    - title: Data science in Genomics ‚òïÔ∏è
      content: 'We are developing and applying an array of statistical learning algorithms for predicting drivers of functional trait evolution (e.g., gene expression), and models of genome evolution.'

*putting the genome into phylogenomics*'
      content: 'We are developing and applying an array of new approaches for dissecting chromosome-scale variation in genealogical history, and for testing hypotheses concerning variation among individuals, populations, and species'
