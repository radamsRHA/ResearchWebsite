I am from Trinidad and Tobago, and recently joined Georgia College as a graduate student in the Biology department. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in applying machine learning to understand processes that influence complex biological data, including genes, genomes, and traits. Outside of my research interests, I love cycling and I'm also an avid Blockchain Enthusiast!
