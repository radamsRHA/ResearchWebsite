# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I’m a sophomore Data Science major at Georgia College and State University and have been working in the Adams lab for about a year, learning new skills and applying them to biological data. My interest in data science is fueled by a love of statistics, and I love that our projects give me the ability to think critically and problem solve. In the future I hope to apply my skills to various types of data, possibly in marketing or working with a non-profit organization. Currently I’m undecided as to what exact direction I’d like to go in, but I look forward to learning more about data science and finding an area I’m truly passionate about!
